          Nowadays, content creation is a critical component of most businesses
          marketing strategies â€” in fact, as of 2020, 70% of marketers now
          actively invest in content marketing. This means the role of content
          writer is more in-demand than ever before. However, the role varies
          depending on both industry and business needs. For instance, some
          businesses might invest heavily in a social media strategy, while
          other companies prefer creating content in the format of blog posts or
          e-books. Regardless of format, a content writer is critical for
          creating high-quality content that represents and strengthens a
          brand's voice, while attracting, engaging, and delighting the right
          audience. When done right, content writing has the power to convert
          readers into prospects, and prospects into paying customers. So it's
          undeniably important for your business' bottom-line that you're able
          to consistently create helpful, engaging content. But that's easier
          said than done. To help take your content to the next level, let's
          dive into some of my favorite content writing tips (these have
          personally helped me, as well).
